## Security

Whenever an application promises security and confidentiality, users just have to trust the developer team. Not only is it challenging to do encryption right, we as users are more and more used to pay with our personal data to benefit from new technologies. We believe that the best way out of this dilemma is to publish the entire code, this is why SilentNotes was turned into an open source project.
